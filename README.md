# MLOPS Project

## Overview

The **MLOPS** project is designed to streamline the deployment and management of machine learning models using best practices in software engineering. This project is structured to accommodate both the main project files and specific configurations for local Airflow deployment via Docker.

## Branches

This repository contains two branches:

- **main**: 
  - This branch includes all files and folders relevant to the MLOPS project. It contains the core functionalities, data processing scripts, model training scripts, and any utilities needed for the project.

- **airflow-config**: 
  - This branch contains the necessary configurations for setting up a local Airflow instance using Docker on Windows OS. It includes Dockerfiles and configuration files required to run Airflow seamlessly in a local environment.

## Key Components

### Hyperparameter Estimation (HPE)

The project utilizes Hyperparameter Estimation (HPE) to optimize model performance. This process involves systematically searching for the best hyperparameters to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the machine learning models being trained.

### Model Training

The **model_training** folder contains scripts dedicated to model estimation. These scripts implement various algorithms and techniques for training models on datasets and fine-tuning their performance based on the results of the hyperparameter estimation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Docker (for the Airflow configuration)
- MongoDB (for data storage and retrieval)
- TensorFlow or other relevant libraries (for model training)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlops.git
   cd mlops
   ```

2. **Switch to the Appropriate Branch**
   - For the main project:

     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```

   - For Airflow configuration:

     ```bash
     git checkout airflow-config
     ```

3. **Set Up the Airflow Environment (if using Airflow)**

   Follow the instructions in the `airflow-config` branch to build and run the Docker containers for Airflow.

### Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the main branch and execute the appropriate scripts as described in the respective folders. Ensure you have all dependencies installed and the database is configured correctly.
